## About

This year is my first year participating in Advent of Code. I will mostly use Ibis to
solve the problems and fall back to UDFs, SQL expressions, or a backend's underlying
API if necessary - or if I want to explore a particular API for fun.

I will also likely use this project to experiment with CI tooling.
