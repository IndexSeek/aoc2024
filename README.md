## About

This year is my first year participating in Advent of Code. I will use Ibis to solve
the problems and fall back to UDFs if necessary.

If I encounter any limitations with a particular backend, I will switch to another
backend and add upstream enhancements where possible to support the operations with
Ibis.

I will also likely use this project to experiment with CI tooling.
